If I'd had more time:
-   Add unit testing

-   Add integration testing

-   Customized CSS without inline styling

-   Worked with headings/layout for mobile viewing more

-   Make a separate table with the specialty names and join on that table / use it for the filter population ux

-   Allow row filtering icons to fit in space by table row headers without reducing text space as much

-   Server-side filtering

-   Allow user to choose multiple specialty selections, improve filtering for longer specialties

-   Add pagination in API call to only call smaller result set to start if needed

-   Defining all prop types
